All notable changes. Versions follow semver; dates are UTC.

## 1.9.4

Positioning visualization + a sweep of correctness/security/doc fixes.

**Chart & price**
- **`render_chart` is now a 3-panel line chart** — 多头持仓 / 空头持仓 / 庄家均价 vs 现价 — each panel on its OWN y-scale, so a side's swings aren't flattened (long ~20M and short ~45M no longer share one axis). The price panel plots long/short whale (庄家) average entry against mark price, so you can see whether the whales are in profit or underwater; a 0-position side's avg no longer anchors the axis at $0. `buildChart` is now async.
- **Mark price is captured per snapshot** — new `price` column (auto-migrated via `ALTER TABLE`), filled from a single batch `ticker/price` call each sweep. `get_change` now returns `price` + per-side `whaleAvg` so a text report can show 现价 vs 庄家均价 P&L. Pre-1.9.4 rows backfill the price line from `klines` at render time (best-effort).

**Correctness**
- **`smartMoneyShareOfOI` no longer double-counts** — it summed both sides (long + short gross notional) but divided by single-sided Open Interest, so it overstated ~2× and could print >100%. Now `gross / (2 × OI)`, clamped to [0,1] (SM's share of total open position-sides).
- **`scanExtreme` no longer drops all-short symbols** — the `longShortRatio > 0` filter excluded symbols with 0 long traders (LSR 0), i.e. exactly the most-short case `mostShort` should surface; replaced with a finite-ratio check (the `minTraders` gate already drops no-data rows).
- **TG push 名义多空比 is a ratio, not a percent** — it rendered `1.5` as "150.00%"; now matches the HTML panel's plain `1.50`.
- **Ticker 24h change / volume are null-guarded** — a malformed payload made `priceChangePct24h` NaN → "NaN%" in the push header; non-finite now degrades to "—".
- **Sub-10-min cache collapse avoided** — the tracker forces a fresh fetch per sweep (a positive-cache hit returned the same snapshot with a frozen `ts`, so `INSERT OR REPLACE` collapsed the series when the interval was under the 10-min cache TTL).

**Proxy (hardening the 1.9.3 feature)**
- Proxy is now resolved **per request** (call-time env + per-host `NO_PROXY`), not once at module load — a `HTTPS_PROXY` set after import, or a `NO_PROXY` excluding one Binance host, is honored. Agents are cached by proxy target so keep-alive holds.
- `proxy-from-env` is now a declared dependency (it was only present transitively via axios, so strict installs — pnpm / Yarn PnP — could silently disable proxying).

**Ops & DX**
- **Daemon liveness** — after 3 consecutive empty sweeps the tracker logs an escalated `STUCK` error, so a permanently blocked IP / dead proxy is visible instead of looping silently while the supervisor shows "online".
- **Tracker `bin`** — `binance-smart-money-oi-monitor-track` lets npm-install (non-clone) users run the tracker without cloning.
- **MCP `period` validated** against the enum before hitting Binance (a bad value was forwarded and returned a misleading "unsupported").
- **CLIs** (`change`/`scan`/`chart`) print an actionable hint on a broken/absent `better-sqlite3` (e.g. ABI mismatch after a Node upgrade) instead of a raw stack trace.
- **Dashboard** binds `127.0.0.1` by default (opt into `0.0.0.0` via `SMART_MONEY_DASHBOARD_HOST`, with a security warning), HTML-escapes reflected `symbol` params (was reflected-XSS), and `/api/*` routes return JSON errors + handle a missing DB gracefully.
- **Docs** — README (EN + 中文) and TROUBLESHOOTING now document `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY`, correct the tool count (10 = 7 live + 3 DB-backed), fix the "no native modules at runtime" wording (native module loads only when a DB tool is called), and show npm-install users how to run the tracker.

## 1.9.3

Proxy support + preflight resilience — makes the tracker and live tools actually work in the geo-restricted setups the docs point at.

- **HTTP(S) proxy support** — `binanceHttp` now honors `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY`, tunneling through a proxy agent when the env names one (and falling back to a direct keep-alive agent otherwise). Previously the custom keep-alive agent silently disabled axios's built-in env-proxy handling, so every request went direct — which made `doctor`'s own "use a proxy / VPS" advice impossible to actually follow from a restricted region. Adds `https-proxy-agent` as a dependency.
- **Preflight retry** — `preflightBinanceFapi()` now retries a transient network blip (socket hang up / ECONNRESET / timeout — common on the first request behind a flaky proxy) up to 3× before declaring the region unreachable, instead of skipping the whole sweep on a single failure. A real WAF block (418 / 403 / 429) still aborts immediately without retry-hammering.

## 1.9.2

Code-review fixes — robustness for library consumers, daemon efficiency, and chart/scan correctness.

- **Lazy native load** — `storage` no longer imports `better-sqlite3` at module load time (it loaded eagerly via `src/index.ts`'s re-exports, crashing consumers whose optional native build failed even if they only used live, non-DB functions). The native addon is now `require`d on first DB use only. `import 'binance-smart-money-oi-monitor'` touches no native module until a DB op runs.
- **Call-time DB path** — the default DB path is resolved by a new `resolveDbPath()` at call time, so a consumer that imports before its `dotenv` runs still honors `SMART_MONEY_DB_PATH`. (Was a module-load-time const.)
- **Smart Money retry** — `waitForBinanceWeightHeadroom()` is now called once per fetch instead of once per retry attempt; a short (120s) negative cache tombstones data-less symbols so they no longer re-do 2 requests + a 400ms wait every sweep. The single transient-blip retry and "stop immediately on 418/block" behavior are preserved.
- **Chart NaN / off-box fix** — `chart.ts` panels now include legit 0-qty points in the y-range (were pushed far off-box) and fall back to safe `lo=0, hi=1` when a panel has no finite values (was `Math.min(...[]) = Infinity → NaN` coords/labels).
- **`scanExtreme` overlap fix** — `mostLong` and `mostShort` can no longer share a symbol when the universe is small (the common case: watchlist ~11-19, default limit 10).
- **Daemon WAL checkpoint** — the tracker daemon now runs `storage.checkpoint()` (`wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) after each sweep so a SIGKILL/OOM mid-write can't strand an uncheckpointed WAL.
- **`exchangeInfo` pooling** — the full-market symbol fetch uses the shared keep-alive `binanceHttp` pool + weight accounting (was bare `axios`) and caches the resolved list for 6h so daemon sweeps stop re-downloading the whole payload.
- **`doctor`** — now prints a WARN row when the DB file exists but `better-sqlite3` is unavailable (previously printed no DB row at all in exactly that case), and reuses `resolveDbPath()` instead of a hand-rolled default.
- **`analyze` cleanup** — profit-ratio rows use the shared `fmtPct` (with its null guard) instead of a local duplicate; PNL rows call `fmtUsd` directly (it already renders `—` for null).

## 1.9.1

Percent-unit fixes (the `oiChg*` fields are already percents; `smShareOfOI`-style ratios are 0..1 fractions — mixing the two up multiplies the display by 100).

- `npm run analyze`: OI 4h change rendered ×100 too big (e.g. `+434.3%` instead of `+4.3%`) — now routed through `fmtChg`. The bug was masked in testing because Binance was unreachable and the field printed `—`.
- Dashboard: the "SM share of OI" column double-multiplied (51.5% showed as `5150.0%`).
- `.dockerignore` now excludes `.env` so local secrets can't be baked into image layers by `COPY . .`.

## 1.9.0

User-experience pass.

- **`SMART_MONEY_DB_PATH`** — point the tracker and the MCP server / dashboard at the same DB regardless of working directory (removes the #1 "time-series tools say no data" footgun).
- **`npm run doctor`** — self-diagnosis: Node version, `better-sqlite3` / `express` availability, Binance reachability, circuit-breaker state, a live sample fetch, and local-DB snapshot count/freshness.
- **`npm run analyze <SYMBOL>`** — one-shot readable terminal report (no server, no AI).
- **MCP prompts** — `positioning`, `squeeze-scan`, `whale-cost` example workflows, so a new user knows what to ask.
- **`--help` / `--version`** on the bin.
- **Full-stack Docker** — `docker compose up -d` now runs altmonitor **+** the tracker **+** the dashboard, sharing one DB volume.
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` and `examples/`.

## 1.8.1

- `getSmartMoneyOverview` retries once on an empty `bapi` body before returning null (a blip no longer looks like "unsupported"); real 418 blocks still stop immediately.
- Dashboard loads `express` via a guarded dynamic import (clear message if the optional dep is missing).
- Tracker daemon warns when a sweep can't finish inside `SMART_MONEY_INTERVAL_MIN`.
- MCP server prints a hint when run bare in a TTY instead of silently waiting.
- Added `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

## 1.8.0

- **Local time-series tracking**: watchlist + self-scheduling daemon (`SMART_MONEY_WATCHLIST`, `SMART_MONEY_INTERVAL_MIN`) — no cron needed.
- `get_change` (per-side added/reduced over N min, in qty not USD), `scan_extreme` (market-wide most long/short-heavy), `render_chart` (long/short position + avg-entry time-series). CLI + library + MCP (now 10 MCP tools).

## 1.7.0

- Current price included in analysis; clearer error messages; README hero.

## 1.6.0 – 1.6.2

- `get_funding` — funding rate turned into money (annualized % + USD per settlement/day/year).
- Data-not-advice disclaimer on every analysis result.
- Baked-in attribution on the shareable cards.

## 1.5.0

- Per-side (long/short) smart-money **and** whale positions in every query — USD notional, average entry, in-profit counts.

## 1.0.0 – 1.4.x

- Initial releases: Binance Smart Signal scraper (17 whale fields) with 7-layer 418/429 protection, SQLite storage, Express dashboard, the MCP server, the shareable panel card, and the bundled `altmonitor` Telegram alert bot.
